User Guide
==========

The user guide is intended as an overview of cuxfilter's capabilities as well as a showcase for examples. The best place to start is `10 Minutes to Cuxfilter`. For more advanced topics, see `Dask-cudf-support` for multi-GPU capabilities and `deployment` for exporting a dashboard for standalone usage outside of a notebook.
